<!---
Please note the following potential times when an issue might be in Terraform core:

* [Configuration Language](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html) or resource ordering issues
* [State](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html) and [State Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html) issues
* [Provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html) issues
* [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
* Spans resources across multiple providers

If you are running into one of these scenarios, we recommend opening an issue in the [Terraform core repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/) instead.

### Panic Output

<!--- If Terraform produced a panic, please provide a link to a GitHub Gist containing the output of the `crash.log`. --->
`Error: private_service_connection.0.subresource_names.0 must only contain upper or lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and periods`


### Expected Behavior

<!--- What should have happened? --->
Private Endpoint created for given sqlServer sub resource (GroupId)

### Actual Behavior

<!--- What actually happened? --->
`Error: private_service_connection.0.subresource_names.0 must only contain upper or lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and periods`
### Steps to Reproduce

<!--- Please list the steps required to reproduce the issue. --->

1. `terraform apply`

### Important Factoids

<!--- Are there anything atypical about your accounts that we should know? For example: Running in a Azure China/Germany/Government? --->
It appears the regex in ValidatePrivateLinkSubResourceName is single character only (`^[\w\.]$`)
