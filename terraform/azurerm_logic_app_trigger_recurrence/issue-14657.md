<!---
Please note the following potential times when an issue might be in Terraform core:

* [Configuration Language](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html) or resource ordering issues
* [State](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html) and [State Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html) issues
* [Provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html) issues
* [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
* Spans resources across multiple providers

If you are running into one of these scenarios, we recommend opening an issue in the [Terraform core repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/) instead.

  # Valid RFC 3339 Date is not accepted

  start_time                   = "2021-12-19T21:00:00"

### Debug Output

<!---
Please provide a link to a GitHub Gist containing the complete debug output. Please do NOT paste the debug output in the issue; just paste a link to the Gist.

To obtain the debug output, see the [Terraform documentation on debugging](https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/debugging.html).
--->

### Panic Output

<!--- If Terraform produced a panic, please provide a link to a GitHub Gist containing the output of the `crash.log`. --->

### Expected Behaviour

<!--- What should have happened? --->
start_time to accept `2021-12-19T21:00:00` as a valid RFC 3339 date

### Actual Behaviour

<!--- What actually happened? --->
start_time requires a `Z` to be appended. This turns the date into a UTC time, so `time_zone` can't effect `start_date`.

### Steps to Reproduce

<!--- Please list the steps required to reproduce the issue. --->

1. `terraform plan`

### Important Factoids

<!--- Are there anything atypical about your accounts that we should know? For example: Running in a Azure China/Germany/Government? --->
[RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) refers to the `Z` as an optional element.
